# Hi there 👋

## 🚀 About Me

👨🏻‍💻 Hi, I'm Win 🥇, a Biomedical Engineering 🩻 graduate from Mahidol University. My field of study is 🧠 Brain-Computer Interface about motor imagery 🚶🏻‍♂️.  

💼 Currently, I'm diving deep into Python development 🐍, especially in the realm of machine learning 🤖. You can catch me tinkering with PyTorch a lot!

Fun fact: I'm fueled by coffee ☕️ and obsessed with custom mechanical keyboards ⌨️.
